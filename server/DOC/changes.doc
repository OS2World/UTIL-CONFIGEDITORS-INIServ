LIST OF CHANGES

Version 2.3
   Rebuild to fix a semaphore leak.
   Added bldlevel information to the executables.
   Added exceptq support.

Version 2.2
   Added the ability to edit TNI files as well as INI files.
   Note: the inied1 client can handle remote TNI files but
      not local TNI files.
   Note: The inied2 and inied3 clients are not yet working and
      therefore not included.  It is possible, depending on
      whether they get promoted in my to-do list, that they
      will never work.

Version 2.1
   Fixed a memory corruption problem.

Version 2.0
   Changed the default INIServe port to 3560/tcp.  This is
      the IANA approved port number for INIServe.
