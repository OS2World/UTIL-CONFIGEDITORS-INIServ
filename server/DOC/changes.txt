LIST OF CHANGES

Version 3.1    (25 Jun 2020)
    You may now supply an -I or -T parameter to INIServe.exe,
        as an explicit specification of whether to take
        its parameters from an INI or TNI file.
    Fixed: random crash when a session times out.
    Fixed: password was being taken from INIServe.INI
        even in TNI mode.
    INIServe.FMT and Setup.FMT added to distribution.
    New command to request a server restart.
    Setup program added to the server package.
    Manual updated.

Version 3.0    (20 Apr 2020)
    New: the R command can now move a file or
        directory between volumes.

Version 2.9    (31 Aug 2019)
   This file renamed from changes.doc to changes.txt.
   Rebuilt to use INIDATA.DLL.
   The inied1 application now allows editing both INI
      and TNI files, either locally or remotely.

Version 2.8    (22 Jul 2017)
   Response to 'F' command is '-' if file cannot be
      opened as an INI or TNI file.

Version 2.7    (19 Jul 2017)
   Updated documentation to make it clear that we can
      handle both INI and TNI files.

Version 2.6    (21 Jul 2015)
   Fixed: truncation of long command lines.
   The server now handles commands of arbitrary length.

Version 2.5     (2 Sep 2014)
   Re-released to include some missing build information.

Version 2.4    (30 Aug 2014)
   Re-released with GPL licence.

Version 2.3
   Rebuild to fix a semaphore leak.
   Added bldlevel information to the executables.
   Added exceptq support.

Version 2.2
   Added the ability to edit TNI files as well as INI files.
   Note: the inied1 client can handle remote TNI files but
      not local TNI files.
   Note: The inied2 and inied3 clients are not yet working and
      therefore not included.  It is possible, depending on
      whether they get promoted in my to-do list, that they
      will never work.

Version 2.1
   Fixed a memory corruption problem.

Version 2.0
   Changed the default INIServe port to 3560/tcp.  This is
      the IANA approved port number for INIServe.
