HOW TO BUILD INISERVE.EXE

This program was built using the XDS Modula-2 compiler, but it
should work with any Modula-2 compiler compatible with the
current language standard.  The project options are specified in
the included file INIServe.prj.  See also the file makezip.cmd, which
is the batch file that was used to generate the zip file that you
received when you obtained this program.  The line in makezip.cmd
that says
      xc =p iniserve.prj
is the command that compiles and links all the modules.

The required files SO32DLL.LIB and TCP32DLL.LIB can be found in
the OS2TK45 directory of most eCS installations.  If you don't have that
directory, search for the OS/2 development toolkit on the usual OS/2
software sites.

The IMPORTS program that is referred to in makezip.cmd is not needed
to make this program, only to zip up the sources.  It is not available at
the time of writing this document, but I'll make it available as freeware
as soon as possible.
