HOW TO BUILD INIED1.EXE

The source file for this INIServe client is the resource file
INIED1.RES.  It contains Rexx code and some other (binary)
information, for use with the development platform DrDialog.
To create the executable, drop INIED1.RES onto the REStoEXE
object that was created when you installed DrDialog.

(I intended to create a client in Modula-2, to avoid the
crypticity of Rexx code, but never found the time to finish
the job. Sorry. But in any case this client is not an essential
part of the INIServe package; it is merely a demonstration.)

DrDialog is an IBM EWS (Employee Written Software) program,
originally available from the IBM Developer Connection web site.
Although IBM appears to have hidden or destroyed most of its
valuable Developer Connection software, you should still be 
able to find DrDialog at http://www.hobbes.nmsu.edu.
