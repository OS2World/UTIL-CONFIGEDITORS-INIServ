This package is a client/server approach to updating INI
files. It is free, and you are explicitly permitted to
redistribute the "server" part with any clients that you
develop yourself.

Versions 2.2 and later of the INIServe server program can handle
both INI and TNI files.  (A TNI file is a human-readable
version of an INI file.  If you want to know more, download
the GenINI package from the same place that you got INIServe.)
The inied1 client that is included here unfortunately
cannot handle local TNI files - that turned out to be too
tricky to do in Rexx - but in remote mode it can deal with
either INI or TNI files, because in that case it is the
server that does most of the work.

In principle, the server part should go on the machine with
the INI files to be edited, and the client part should go
on the machine where you're going to do the editing.  For
evaluation purposes, however, it's safe to put both parts on
the same machine. You can even put them in the same directory
if you prefer.

To install, unzip the appropriate zip file (client.zip or
server.zip) into a directory of your choice. The two programs
should be immediately ready to run.

The documentation is in the server package.  The client is
supposed to be sufficiently user-friendly that it doesn't need
any documentation.  (Please let me know if that's wrong.)

If you want to develop your own client software, you can take
the source code for this one as a starting point. My inied1 client
was developed using DrDialog, which is a Rexx-based system
available originally available free from the IBM Developer
Connection, and which still can be found on Hobbes.  Rexx is not
my favourite programming language, but I have to admit that
DrDialog lets you get this sort of application working very
quickly.
